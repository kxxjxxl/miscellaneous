🛑 So hello guys

✔So I created this very simple webapp with HTML basics which is a server side language python based including the following concepts & some extra things --> 👀

Core API concept
Core CGI concept( i used cgi-bin folder for apache http server)
Http protocol
Python script --> including she bang lines & header lines for web browser
Difference between webpage(static) & webapp(program runs & output shown to u)
I used subprocess module instead of os module due to some of it's limitations
Used the cgi field storage concept for retreiving variables from clients👨‍💻
